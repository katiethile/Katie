<h1>Process of how our website was created</h1>  
<p class="ss">We first took into consideration of what were the requirements that was needed to complete this website. For example, how many pages was needed, and through that, we divided up the pages to be the introduction for the first page, then the next 4 pages in the middle is each of our own personal page, describing us and our hobbies, and finally, the last page would be the conclusion/closing page describing the process. Our thought process was, since we all have different schedule and cannot all meet up often, we decided to divide up the work and work on our own time, with divided sections, then compile everything up at the end. This ended up working really well and everything clicked once we started working on it. Now, we will each take turns describing which part was the hardest, easiest, and the process of how we each made everything work for our part.</p>

<h4>Katie's POV</h4>
  <p class="ss">Hi all! First off, going into this project, I was super nervous. I am not the best at Javascript. I have taken a course of JS before, but didn't end up doing so well. I just started off with what I knew first, and went from there. HTML was what I am best at, and so I did everything in HTML first. Then, I incorportated my images into my file. I had forgotten how to do that for a minute, so I had to search that up. As for the CSS portion, we had taken notes before for writing CSS in a class before, and so I had just looked back on the notes and use the notes to apply to the CSS portion. It was really a life savior for that portion. I had a lot of fun playing with the styling portion. I like to also color coordinate things and make things align, so I spent a good amount of time on that part, making everything my favorite color. I also had a hard time thinking of specific hobbies that I have, as I do not particularly excel at anything really. I just talked about what I enjoy doing, and what I had picked up recently doing. It was like discovering myself as well, so it was interesting and fun to do.</p>
